# PawHub

PawHub is a web application that helps pet owners connect with other pet owners, find local resources for their pets, and learn about different breeds and pet care. This project includes a discussion board, explore page, map page, and a resources section, which includes a breed information page, and a video page.

### Features

Map Page: Users can find the closest veterinarians or pet stores based on their inputted location.

Resources Section: The breed list page allows users to search for any dog breed and it will provide a picture, country of origin, and a link to the Wikipedia page of that dog.
